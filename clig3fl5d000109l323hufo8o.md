Welcome back to our Terraform journey! In the previous blog post, we learned about Terraform blocks and resources. Today, we will take a deeper dive into working with Terraform resources and continue building our infrastructure. So, grab your cup of ‚òï and let's get started!

## Understanding Terraform Resources üìö

In the world of Terraform, a resource represents a crucial component of your infrastructure. It could be anything from a physical server to a virtual machine, a DNS record, or even an S3 bucket. These resources come with their unique set of attributes that define their properties and behaviors. For instance, a virtual machine resource might have attributes like size and location, while a DNS record resource could have attributes like domain name.

To define a resource in Terraform, you need to specify the resource type, a unique name, and the attributes that characterize it. In your Terraform configuration, you'll utilize the resource block to define these resources and bring your infrastructure to life.

## Task 1: Create a security group üë•

To kick things off, we need to create a security group to allow traffic to our EC2 instance. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Open your [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) file and add the following code snippet to create a security group:
    

```bash
resource "aws_security_group" "web_server" {
  name_prefix = "web-server-sg"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

1. Run `terraform init` in your terminal to initialize the Terraform project.

2. Execute `terraform apply` to create the security group.

## Task 2: Create an EC2 instance üíª

Now, let's move on to creating an EC2 instance using Terraform. Follow these steps:

1. Open your [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) file and add the following code snippet to create an EC2 instance:
    

```bash

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

// main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web_server" {
  name_prefix = "web-server-sg"
  ingress { 
     from_port   = 22 
     to_port     = 22 
     protocol    = "tcp" 
     cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] 
   } 
  
   ingress { 
     from_port   = 80 
     to_port     = 80 
     protocol    = "tcp" 
     cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] 
   } 
  
   ingress { 
     from_port   = 443 
     to_port     = 443 
     protocol    = "tcp" 
     cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] 
   } 
  
   egress { 
     from_port   = 0 
     to_port     = 0 
     protocol    = "-1" 
     cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] 
   }

}


resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "myself"
  security_groups = [
    aws_security_group.web_server.name
  ]
   tags = {
    Name = "web_server"
  }

 
user_data = <<-EOF
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install python3 -y
 sudo apt-get install -y apache2
 sudo systemctl start apache2     
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo apt 
touch /home/ubuntu/index.html
echo "<html><body><h1>Welcome to my website!</h1></body></html>" > /home/ubuntu/index.html

nohup python3 -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 &
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
EOF

 provisioner "file" {
    source      = "/home/ubuntu/index.html"
    destination = "/var/www/html/index.html"
  }
}
```

Note: Replace the `ami` and `key_name` values with your own. You can find a list of available AMIs in the AWS documentation.

1. Run `terraform apply` to create the EC2 instance.

## Task 3: Access your website üåê

With the EC2 instance up and running, it's time to access the website hosted on it. Follow these simple steps:

1. Open your favorite web browser and enter the public IP address of your EC2 instance.

2. Voil√†! You should see your website's homepage with the message "Welcome to my website!" displayed prominently.
    

Congratulations! You have successfully created a security group, launched an EC2 instance, and accessed your website using Terraform. üéâ
