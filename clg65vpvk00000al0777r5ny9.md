A package manager is a software tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages. It typically uses a centralized repository of packages to download and install software and its dependencies. Package managers help users manage software installations and updates, ensure that software is installed with the correct dependencies and configuration, and simplify the process of software installation.

Some popular package managers include:

* APT (Advanced Package Tool) for Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu.
    
* YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified) and DNF (Dandified YUM) for Red Hat-based Linux distributions like CentOS and Fedora.
    

Homebrew for macOS.

**Task 1. You have to install docker and jenkins in your system from your terminal using package managers**

Install Docker:

For Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:

1. Update the package list:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    
2. Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
    ```
    
3. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
    
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```
    
4. Use the following command to set up the stable repository:
    
    ```bash
    echo \
      "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
      $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```
    
5. Update the package list with the Docker packages from the newly added repository:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    
6. Finally, install Docker:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    ```
    
    For CentOS or RHEL-based systems:
    
    1. Install the required packages:
        
        ```bash
        sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
        ```
        
    2. Use the following command to set up the stable repository:
        
        ```bash
        sudo yum-config-manager \
            --add-repo \
            https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
        ```
        
    3. Install Docker:
        
        ```bash
        sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
        ```
        
        Install Jenkins:
        
        For Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:
        
        1. Add the Jenkins repository key to the system:
            
            ```bash
            wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
            ```
            
        2. Add the Jenkins repository to the system:
            
            ```bash
            sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
            ```
            
        3. Update the package list:
            
            ```bash
            sudo apt update
            ```
            
        4. Finally, install Jenkins:
            
            ```bash
            sudo apt install jenkins
            ```
            
            For CentOS or RHEL-based systems:
            
            1. Add the Jenkins repository to the system:
                
                ```bash
                sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
                ```
                
            2. Import the Jenkins repository key:
                
                ```bash
                sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
                ```
                
            3. Install Jenkins:
                
                ```bash
                sudo yum install jenkins
                ```
                
            
            **Task 2. check the status of docker service in your system (make sure you completed above tasks, else docker won't be installed)** To check the status of the Docker service on your system, you can use the following command:
            
            ```bash
            sudo systemctl status docker
            ```
            
            This will display the current status of the Docker service, including whether it is running or not, any errors or warnings, and other relevant information. If the service is running, you should see a message similar to the following:
            
            ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680847027952/c0878a4e-6cde-42e2-97e6-9b0dee617124.png align="center")
            

If the service is not running, you can start it using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

And then check its status again using the above command.

**Task 3. Stop the service jenkins and post before and after screenshots**

Cheack the status of jenkins

1. To stop the Jenkins service, use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop jenkins
    ```
    
    After this command :
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680848090654/7c1b9d8f-a97b-435f-8a48-d9a88f353fa6.png align="center")
    

**Task 3. read about the commands systemctl vs service.**

`systemctl` and `service` are two different commands used in Linux to manage system services.

`systemctl` is a newer command introduced with systemd, a system and service manager for Linux. It is used to control and manage the systemd system and service manager. `systemctl` allows you to start, stop, restart, enable, and disable services, and also to view the status of services.

The `service` command, on the other hand, is an older command that is still used on some Linux systems. It is used to start, stop, and restart services, and also to view the status of services. However, unlike `systemctl`, `service` does not allow you to enable or disable services.

While both commands can be used to manage services, `systemctl` is generally considered to be the preferred command because it is more powerful and flexible, and allows you to do more than the `service` command. It also has more features and options, and is more standardized across different Linux distributions.

So, in summary, `systemctl` is a newer and more powerful command used to manage systemd services, while `service` is an older and simpler command used to manage system services on some Linux systems.
