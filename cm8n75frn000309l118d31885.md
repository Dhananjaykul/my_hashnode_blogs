## **Introduction**

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a core AWS service that provides scalable compute capacity. While many users understand basic EC2 functionalities, diving into advanced concepts is essential for designing robust, efficient, and cost-effective architectures. This post covers key advanced EC2 features, including **IP addressing, Placement Groups, and EC2 Hibernate**, crucial for the AWS Solutions Architect exam. Additionally, we include hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.

## **IP Addressing in EC2**

EC2 instances rely on IP addresses for communication within AWS and the internet. Understanding IP address types and their uses is crucial for efficient networking.

### **Types of IP Addresses:**

* **IPv4:** The most widely used addressing system, with approximately 3.7 billion public addresses.
    
* **IPv6:** A newer addressing system designed to overcome IPv4 limitations, supporting IoT devices and large-scale applications.
    

### **Public vs. Private IP Addresses:**

* **Public IP:** Assigned automatically but changes when an instance stops and starts.
    
* **Private IP:** Used for internal AWS communication within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
    
* **Elastic IP:** A static public IP address assigned to an instance, ideal for maintaining constant connectivity.
    

### **Network Address Translation (NAT):**

* **NAT Gateway:** Allows instances with private IPs to access the internet.
    
* **Standard Private IP Ranges:**
    
    * 10.0.0.0/8
        
    * 172.16.0.0/12
        
    * 192.168.0.0/16
        

### **Hands-on: Working with IP Addresses**

1. Launch an EC2 instance in your AWS console.
    
2. Note the assigned **Public IP** and **Private IP**.
    
3. Stop and start the instance; observe the public IP change. ( All these steps are covered in previous blogs in this series. I kindly request that you refer to those.)
    
4. Allocate and associate an **Elastic IP** to the instance (Locate the Elastic IP in the EC2 dashboard. Keep in mind that using an Elastic IP incurs a charge, so after you apply it, remember to clean up.).
    
5. Test connectivity by using SSH to connect to the instance using both public and Elastic IPs.

## **EC2 Placement Groups**

Placement groups help optimize EC2 instanceâ€™s placement for performance, availability, or fault tolerance.

### **Types of Placement Groups:**

1. **Cluster Placement Group:**
    
    * Groups instances within a single Availability Zone for low-latency, high-bandwidth networking.
        
    * **Use cases:** High-performance computing (HPC), big data applications.
        
2. **Spread Placement Group:**
    
    * Spreads instances across multiple hardware racks to reduce failure risk (max 7 instances per group per AZ).
        
    * **Use cases:** Mission-critical applications requiring high availability.
        
3. **Partition Placement Group:**
    
    * Divides instances into partitions across multiple racks.
        
    * **Use cases:** Distributed databases (Cassandra, Hadoop, Kafka).
        

### **Hands-on: Creating and Using Placement Groups**

1. In the AWS console, navigate to **EC2 &gt; Placement Groups**.
    
2. Click **Create Placement Group** and choose one of the three strategies.
    
3. Launch multiple EC2 instances and place them in the group.
    
4. Test network performance between instances using tools like `iperf3`.

## **EC2 Hibernate**

EC2 Hibernate allows instances to be paused and resumed while preserving the system state.

### **How EC2 Hibernate Works:**

* When an instance is hibernated, its RAM contents are saved to the root **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** volume.
    
* On restart, the OS and applications resume instantly, reducing boot time.
    

### **Key Considerations:**

* **Supported Instance Families:** C3, C4, C5, M3, M4, R3, R4.
    
* **RAM Size Limit:** Up to 150 GB.
    
* **Storage Requirements:** Root EBS volume must be encrypted.
    
* **Instance Limitations:** Not available for bare-metal instances and cannot be hibernated for more than **60 days**.
    

### **Hands-on: Using EC2 Hibernate**

1. Launch an EC2 instance using a **supported instance type**.
    
2. Enable **Hibernate** during instance launch.
    
3. Connect to the instance and check uptime using `uptime` command.
    
4. Hibernate the instance from **Instance State &gt; Hibernate**.
    
5. Start the instance again and verify that uptime persists.
