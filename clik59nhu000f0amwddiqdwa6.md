Welcome back to our AWS journey! Today, we will explore the fascinating world of Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) üåê. S3 is not just any storage service, it's like a magical treasure chest üéÅ that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Whether you need to store and retrieve data, host static websites, or fulfill other use cases, S3 has got your back! Let's embark on a thrilling hands-on adventure and learn how to create and manage S3 buckets using Terraform. Let the magic begin! ‚ú®üöÄ

## Prerequisites ‚ú®üîß

Before diving into the hands-on task, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Terraform Installation** üåçüîß: Ensure that you have Terraform installed on your system. You can download and install Terraform from the official website: [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
    
2. **AWS Account** üíªüåê: To perform the S3 bucket creation and management, you need an AWS account. If you don't have one, you can create a free account at [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
    
3. **Terraform Configuration Files** üìÑüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Create the following configuration files in your project directory:
    
    * [`variables.tf`](http://variables.tf) üß©: This file will define any variables used in the Terraform configuration.
        
    * [`provider.tf`](http://provider.tf) ‚öôÔ∏è: This file will specify the AWS provider configuration.
        
4. **AWS Provider Configuration** ‚ö°Ô∏èüåç: In the [`provider.tf`](http://provider.tf) file, add the AWS provider configuration with the desired region. Here's an example of how it should look:
    
    ```bash
    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-east-1"
    }
    ```
    
    Replace `"us-east-1"` with your preferred AWS region.
    
5. **Terraform Version Configuration** üèóÔ∏èüîç: In your [`terraform.tf`](http://terraform.tf) file, add the required providers block to specify the version of the AWS provider you want to use:
    
    ```bash
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        aws = {
          source  = "hashicorp/aws"
          version = "~> 4.0"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    This ensures that Terraform uses the specified AWS provider version.
    

Make sure you have these prerequisites in place before proceeding with the hands-on task. Once you have everything set up, you'll be ready to create and manage your AWS S3 bucket using Terraform! üöÄüí°

## Task: Hands-On ‚úãüíª

### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket using Terraform

To kickstart our journey, let's create an S3 bucket using Terraform. Follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open your preferred text editor and create a file named [`S3.tf`](http://S3.tf). 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add the following Terraform code to define your S3 bucket resource:

```bash
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "devops_bucket" {
  bucket = "devopsbucketday67"
}
```

Feel free to replace `"devopsbucketday67"` with a unique name that resonates with your mission.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Save the file. Keep it safe, as we'll need it later.

### Step 2: Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open your terminal or command prompt. Get ready to unleash the Terraform magic ‚ú®.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the directory where your [`S3.tf`](http://S3.tf) file resides.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cast the spell "terraform init" to initialize Terraform and prepare for the enchanting changes:

```shell
terraform init
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ After the initialization is complete, cast the spell "terraform plan" to preview the magical changes that will take place:

```shell
terraform plan
```

Review the changes and ensure they align with your magical intentions.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, utter the incantation "terraform apply" to bring the Terraform configuration to life and create the S3 bucket:

```shell
terraform apply
```

When prompted, embrace the magic and type "yes" to confirm the creation of the bucket.

6Ô∏è‚É£ To witness the manifestation of your creation, navigate to the AWS Management Console and open the S3 service. Behold! Your bucket, named `devopsbucketday67`, has come to life! üåü

### Step 3: Configure the Bucket to Allow Public Read Access

Now that your bucket exists, let's grant public read access to the objects within it. Follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare yourself for the next spell. Create a file named `public_access.tf`. This will hold the configuration to grant public access to your bucket.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Channel your powers and add the following Terraform incantations to the `public_access.tf` file:

```bash
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example" {
  bucket                     = aws_s3_bucket.devops_bucket.id
  block_public_acls          = false
  block_public_policy        = false
  ignore_public_acls         = false
  restrict_public_buckets    = false
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "bucket_acl" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.devops_bucket.id
  acl    = "public-read"
}
```

Ensure that `aws_s3_bucket.devops_bucket.id` references the correct identifier for your bucket.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Save the file. Keep your wand ready, as we're about to cast some powerful spells!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Enable the ACL in the S3 bucket by following these additional steps:

* Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    
* Find your bucket, `devopsbucketday67`, and select it.
    
* Choose the "Permissions" tab.
    
* Under "Access Control List (ACL)", select "Bucket owner preferred".
    
* Save the change.

Now your S3 bucket is not only publicly accessible but also configured with the preferred ACL settings. The magic of accessibility is at your fingertips! ü™Ñ‚ú®

5Ô∏è‚É£ Cast the spell "terraform apply" to apply the public access configuration to your S3 bucket:

```shell
terraform apply
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686045438686/78a48cb4-1291-45d1-b2d4-dc152e808c7c.png align="center")

Let the magic flow and watch as public access is granted to your bucket. Feel the power of openness! üîì

6Ô∏è‚É£ Check your bucket in the AWS Management Console. Behold! The doors to public access have been opened! üö™üåê

### Step 4: Create an S3 Bucket Policy for Read-Only Access

To control access to your bucket, let's create an S3 bucket policy that allows read-only access to a specific IAM user or role. Prepare yourself for the next enchantment:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Focus your magical energy and create a file named [`IAM.tf`](http://IAM.tf). This is where we'll define the configuration for IAM access to the S3 bucket.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Embrace the power of Terraform and add the following incantations to the [`IAM.tf`](http://IAM.tf) file:

```bash
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "bucket_policy" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.devops_bucket.id
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.allow_read_only_access.json
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "allow_read_only_access" {
  statement {
    principals {
      type        = "AWS"
      identifiers = ["arn:aws:iam::636389623226:user/Mark_furry"]
    }

    actions = [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:ListBucket",
    ]

    resources = [
      aws_s3_bucket.devops_bucket.arn,
      "${aws_s3_bucket.devops_bucket.arn}/*",
    ]
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `"636389623226"` with the identifier of the IAM user or role you want to grant read-only access to.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Save the file. Keep your wand close, for we are about to cast another mighty spell!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Cast the spell "terraform apply" to apply the IAM configuration and grant the specified access to the S3 bucket:

```shell
terraform apply
```

Witness the power of your incantations as read-only access is bestowed upon the chosen IAM entity! üìúüîí

5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the bucket policy in the AWS Management Console. You've successfully wielded the magic of access control! üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîë

### Step 5: Enable Versioning on the S3 Bucket

To add another layer of magic to your S3 bucket, let's enable versioning:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open your trusty [`S3.tf`](http://S3.tf) file.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Enhance the existing Terraform incantations for the `aws_s3_bucket` resource by adding the versioning configuration:

```bash
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "devops_bucket" {
  bucket = "devopsbucketday67"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Save the file. Your wand shall be your guide as we continue our magical journey!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Cast the spell "terraform apply" once again to enable versioning in your S3 bucket:

```shell
terraform apply
```

Feel the surge of power as versioning is bestowed upon your bucket! Keep track of the enchanted versions! üìö‚ú®

5Ô∏è‚É£ Behold the changes in the AWS Management Console for your S3 bucket. Versioning is now enabled! Witness the power of history unfolding before your eyes! üìú‚è≥
