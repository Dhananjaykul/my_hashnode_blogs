In our previous blog post, we explored AWS CodeCommit and its benefits in managing version control for software development projects. 📚👩‍💻 If you missed it, catch up on the comprehensive guide [<mark>here</mark>](https://dhananjaykulkarni.hashnode.dev/getting-started-with-aws-codecommit-a-comprehensive-guide) . Continuing our journey into the AWS DevOps ecosystem, today we focus on AWS CodeBuild 🌟💡. This blog post will guide you through the process of using CodeBuild to streamline your build process, from creating a Buildspec file to deploying an application using an nginx server. Let's dive in!

## **<mark>Task-01: Setting Up CodeBuild and Creating an index.html File</mark>**

1. Familiarize Yourself with Buildspec: Start by understanding the concept of the Buildspec file, which is a YAML or JSON file that defines the build specifications and commands for CodeBuild.
    
2. Create index.html in CodeCommit: In your initialized CodeCommit repository, add a simple index.html file that will be used for the build process. This file contains the HTML code for your application.

3. Commit and Push Changes: Commit the changes made to the repository and push them to the origin master branch.

4. Create a CodeBuild Project: In the AWS CodeBuild service, navigate to the "Codebuild" section and create a new build project.

    Give it a meaningful name, such as "DemoApp-BuildProject," and provide a descriptive description.
    
5. Configure Source Provider: Select AWS CodeCommit as the source provider and choose the appropriate repository name.

6. Specify Branch: Set the reference type to the master branch, which will be used for the build process.
    
7. Configure Environment: Select Ubuntu as the operating system, and choose the runtime standard image as "aws/codebuild/standard:6.0."

8. Create a New Service Role: Specify a name for the new service role, which will provide the necessary permissions for CodeBuild to perform its tasks.

## **<mark>Task-02: Completing the Build Process with buildspec.yaml</mark>**

1. Create buildspec.yaml: Inside your local directory, create a buildspec.yml file that will be used by CodeBuild to execute the build process. Use this file to run the simple HTML code created in the previous task.
    
    ```yaml
    version: 0.3
    
    phases:
      pre_build:
        commands:
          - echo "Starting build"
          - echo "Installing nginx"
          - apt-get update
          - apt-get install -y nginx
      build:
        commands:
          - echo "Copying files to nginx directory"
          - cp index.html /var/www/html/index.html
      post_build:
        commands:
          - echo "Configuring nginx"
          - sed -i 's/80 default_server/8080 default_server/' /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
          - service nginx restart
    
    artifacts:
      files:
        - /var/www/html/index.html
    ```
    
2. Update Build Project: Add the buildspec file to the CodeCommit repository. Modify the build project configuration to reference this file for the build process.
