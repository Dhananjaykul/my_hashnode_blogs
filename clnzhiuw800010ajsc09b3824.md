    * Creating your own modules
        
4. **Reusing Code with Functions**
    
5. The solution to the previous part
    
6. Exercises
    

Let's dive into each of these topics in detail.

## 1\. Defining Functions

### Using the `def` Keyword

In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

### Function Parameters

Functions can take parameters, which are values that are passed into the function. These parameters can be used inside the function to perform operations.

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### Return Statements

Functions can return values using the `return` statement. This allows functions to produce results that can be used in other parts of your code.

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x
```

## 2\. Scope and Namespaces

Python uses a concept called "scope" to determine where in your code a variable can be used. Understanding scope is crucial for managing variables and functions effectively.

## 3\. Importing Modules

### Standard Library Modules

Python's standard library is a collection of modules that provide a wide range of functionality. You can import these modules to access their features.

```python
import math

# Calculate the square root of a number
result = math.sqrt(25)
```

### Third-Party Libraries

Python's ecosystem is enriched with third-party libraries. You can install and use these libraries to expand your capabilities.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load a dataset using the Pandas library
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
```

### Creating Your Own Modules

You can create your own modules to organize and reuse your code. A module is simply a Python file containing functions, variables, and classes.

```python
# mymodule.py
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"

# main.py
import mymodule

result = mymodule.greet("Dhananjay")
```

## 4\. Reusing Code with Functions

Functions allow you to encapsulate and reuse code. By calling a function with the appropriate parameters, you can perform a specific task without rewriting the same code.

## Examples

### Defining and Using Functions

```python
# Define a function that calculates the area of a rectangle
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width

# Use the function
area = calculate_area(5, 3)
print("Area of the rectangle:", area)
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
Area of the rectangle: 15
```

### Scope and Namespaces

```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def my_function():
    y = 20  # Local variable
    print("Inside the function, x is", x)
    print("Inside the function, y is", y)

my_function()
print("Outside the function, x is", x)
# Attempting to print y outside the function will result in an error
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
Inside the function, x is 10
Inside the function, y is 20
Outside the function, x is 10
```

### Importing Modules

```python
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 100
random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
print("Random number:", random_number)
```

**Expected Output:**

(Example output will vary as it's a random number)

```bash
Random number: 42
```

### Creating Your Own Module

* Create a file named [`mymodule.py`](http://mymodule.py):
    

```python
# mymodule.py
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

* Use the module in another file:
    

```python
import mymodule

result = mymodule.greet("Dhananjay")
print(result)
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
Hello, Dhananjay!
```

## Solution to Previous Exercises

### Exercise 1: Calculate the Factorial

**Question:** Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for loop.

**Solution:**

```python
# Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
def calculate_factorial(number):
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, number + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial

# Test the function
number = 5
result = calculate_factorial(number)
print(f"Factorial of {number} is {result}")
```

**Expected Output:**

```python
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

**Explanation:** The program defines a function `calculate_factorial` that takes an input number. It initializes `factorial` to 1 and uses a `for` loop to calculate the factorial by iterating from 1 to the given number. The result is returned and printed.

### Exercise 2: Calculate the Sum

**Question:** Create a list of numbers and use a while loop to find the sum of all the numbers in the list.

**Solution:**

```python
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Initialize variables
total = 0
index = 0

# Use a while loop to calculate the sum
while index < len(numbers):
    total += numbers[index]
    index += 1

# Print the result
print("Sum of numbers:", total)
```

**Expected Output:**

```python
Sum of numbers: 150
```

**Explanation:** The program defines a list of numbers and uses a `while` loop to iterate through the list. It initializes the variables `total` and `index`, and for each iteration, it adds the value at the current index to the `total`. After processing all elements, it prints the sum.

### Exercise 3: Count Letters in Words

**Question:** Given a list of words, use a `for` loop to count and print the number of letters in each word.

**Solution:**

```python
# Define a list of words
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Use a for loop to count letters in each word
for word in words:
    letter_count = len(word)
    print(f"The word '{word}' has {letter_count} letters.")
```

**Expected Output:**

```python
The word 'apple' has 5 letters.
The word 'banana' has 6 letters.
The word 'cherry' has 6 letters.
The word 'date' has 4 letters.
```

**Explanation:** The program defines a list of words and uses a `for` loop to iterate through the list. For each word, it calculates the number of letters using the `len()` function and prints the result.

### Exercise 4: Filter Even Numbers

**Question:** Write a program that takes a list of numbers and uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**Solution:**

```python
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Use a list comprehension to filter even numbers
even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

# Print the result
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
```

**Expected Output:**

```python
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Explanation:** The program defines a list of numbers and uses a list comprehension to create a new list called `even_numbers` that contains only the even numbers from the original list. The condition `x % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even. The result is printed.

These solutions should help you understand and practice the concepts of loops and iteration in Python.

## Exercise

Now, let's apply your knowledge of functions and modules with some exercises:

**Exercise 1:** Create a Python module named `math_operations` that contains functions to calculate the area and circumference of a circle based on its radius. Then, create a script that imports this module and uses the functions to calculate the area and circumference of a circle with a radius of 5 units.

**Exercise 2:** Develop a Python module named `string_utilities` that contains functions for common string operations, such as counting the number of words in a string, reversing a string, and checking if a string is a palindrome. Create a script that imports this module and demonstrates the use of these functions on a sample string.

**Exercise 3:** Create a Python module named `file_io` that contains functions for reading and writing text files. Implement functions to read the contents of a text file and write a list of strings to a new text file. Develop a script that imports this module, reads the contents of a sample text file, and writes the content to a new file with a different name.

**Exercise 4:** Design a Python module named `data_analysis` that includes functions to calculate the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers. Develop a script that imports this module and uses these functions to analyze a list of data.

**Exercise 5:** Create a Python module named `web_scraper` that contains a function to scrape data from a website of your choice (e.g., weather information, news headlines, or stock prices). Then, write a script that imports this module and uses the web scraping function to retrieve and display the data.
