Welcome back to our Python for Scripting series! In this episode, we're diving deep into the fascinating world of Regular Expressions (regex) in Python. Buckle up as we explore the ins and outs of regex for powerful text manipulation!

## Understanding Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define search patterns. They act as a secret code to find, extract, or manipulate specific pieces of text. The `re` module in Python empowers us to work magic with these patterns.

## Exploring the `re` Module for Pattern Matching

Let's kick off our regex adventure by finding occurrences of the word "world" in a text:

```python
import re

pattern = r"world"
text = "Hello, world! How's the world treating you?"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Occurrences of 'world':", len(matches))
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
Occurrences of 'world': 2
```

This code snippet uses `re.findall()` to search for the pattern "world" within the text and counts how many times it appears.

## Common Regex Patterns: Unveiling the Magic

### 1\. Literal Matches

Consider finding instances of the word "apple" in a text:

```python
pattern = r"apple"
text = "An apple a day keeps the doctor away. I love apples!"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Occurrences of 'apple':", len(matches))
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
Occurrences of 'apple': 2
```

### 2\. Character Classes

Let's explore extracting vowels from a sentence:

```python
pattern = r"[aeiou]"
text = "Regular expressions are amazing!"

vowels = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Vowels found:", vowels)
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
Vowels found: ['e', 'u', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'o', 'a', 'i']
```

### 3\. Quantifiers

Extracting years from a sentence:

```python
pattern = r"\d{2,4}"
text = "Python 3.9 was released in 2020."

years = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Years found:", years)
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
Years found: ['3', '9', '2020']
```

## Validating and Extracting Data with Regex

### 1\. Email Validation

Verify the validity of an email address:

```python
pattern = r"[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+"
email = "user@example.com"

if re.match(pattern, email):
    print("Valid email address.")
else:
    print("Invalid email address.")
```

### 2\. Extracting Dates

Extract dates from a text:

```python
pattern = r"\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}"
text = "Date: 12/31/2022, Meeting on 05/15/2023"

dates = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Dates found:", dates)
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
Dates found: ['12/31/2022', '05/15/2023']
```

Understanding these regex patterns allows us to perform precise text operations. The examples provided showcase their versatility in searching, validating, and extracting information from text data. Practice these patterns to wield the power of regex effectively in your Python scripts! Stay tuned for more Python scripting adventures.

## Solutions to Exercises from the Previous Blog

### Exercise 1: Counting Words in a Text File

```python
# Open the file in read mode
with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    text = file.read()
    word_count = len(text.split())

print("Number of words in the file:", word_count)
```

**Explanation:**

* `open('sample.txt', 'r')`: Opens the file named 'sample.txt' in read mode.
    
* [`file.read`](http://file.read)`()`: Reads the entire content of the file and stores it in the variable `text`.
    
* `text.split()`: Splits the text into words based on spaces and returns a list.
    
* `len(text.split())`: Calculates the length of the list of words, which represents the total number of words in the file.
    

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
Number of words in the file: 56
```

### Exercise 2: Appending User Input to an Existing File

```python
user_input = input("Enter text to append: ")

with open('existing_file.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write('\n' + user_input)
```

**Explanation:**

* `input("Enter text to append: ")`: Prompts the user to enter text.
    
* `open('existing_file.txt', 'a')`: Opens the file 'existing\_file.txt' in append mode.
    
* `file.write('\n' + user_input)`: Appends the user's input to the file on a new line.
    

### Exercise 3: Writing String to a File in Append Mode

```python
def write_to_file(filename, text):
    with open(filename, 'a') as file:
        file.write('\n' + text)

write_to_file('data.txt', 'This text will be appended to the file.')
```

**Explanation:**

* `def write_to_file(filename, text)`: Defines a function that takes a filename and a string as arguments.
    
* `file.write('\n' + text)`: Appends the provided text to the file in append mode.
    

### Exercise 4: Reading and Printing CSV Contents

```python
import csv

with open('data.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        print(', '.join(row))
```

**Explanation:**

* `import csv`: Imports the CSV module for handling CSV files.
    
* `csv.reader(csvfile)`: Creates a CSV reader object.
    
* `for row in reader: print(', '.join(row))`: Iterates through each row of the CSV file and prints its contents as a table.
    

### Exercise 5: Searching for a Specific Word in a Text File

```python
search_word = 'specific'
with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line_num, line in enumerate(file, 1):
        if search_word in line:
            print(f"Word found at line {line_num}: {line.strip()}")
```

**Explanation:**

* `search_word = 'specific'`: Specifies the word to search.
    
* `enumerate(file, 1)`: Enumerates through each line of the file, starting from line 1.
    
* `if search_word in line: print(f"Word found at line {line_num}: {line.strip()}")`: Checks if the search word is present in each line and displays the line number and line content where the word is found.
    

These solutions provide practical implementations for the exercises, showcasing how Python can effectively handle file operations and text processing tasks.
