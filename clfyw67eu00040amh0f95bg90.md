Day 2: #90DaysOfDevOps Challange

## What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system. It's also one of the most popular operating systems in use today, with millions of users worldwide.  
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since grown into an enormous community of developers who contribute code to improve its performance, stability and usability. The Linux kernel itself is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which means that anyone can modify it as long as they release their modified version under the same license.

## Linux Applications

* ***Servers***  
    Linux is the most popular operating system for web servers. It's also used in supercomputers and embedded systems (devices like smartphones).
    
* ***Supercomputers***  
    Linux powers more than half of the world's top 500 fastest supercomputers, including Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which was recently ranked as number 1 with a peak performance of 200 petaflops (200 quadrillion calculations per second).
    

## Benefits of Linux

* ***Stable***  
    Linux is a stable operating system that has been around for decades. It's used in everything from servers to supercomputers, and it's proven itself to be reliable in all kinds of situations.
    
* ***Reliable***  
    Linux has been built to be reliable from the start--and it shows! You can count on your Linux-based systems to work as they should, every time you turn them on or reboot them after an update or upgrade (which we'll talk about later).
    
* ***Secure***  
    Linux has always had good security features baked right into its core architecture; these include things like firewall settings that prevent unauthorized access attempts by hackers trying to break into your network through an open port on one of your computers' network cards (NCs).
    

## Linux Distributions

Linux distributions are the operating systems that you can install on your computer. There are many different Linux distributions available, but we're going to focus on the most popular ones:

* Debian
    
* Ubuntu
    
* Fedora (Red Hat)
    
* Arch Linux
    
* openSUSE
    

## Linux Desktop Environments

There are several desktop environments available for Linux, with each offering its unique look and feel. For example, GNOME is one of the most popular desktop environments in use today. It's based on the GTK+ toolkit and uses the Mutter window manager as its compositor. KDE (K Desktop Environment) is another popular option that offers a wide range of applications and tools for users' needs. Xfce is another lightweight desktop environment that focuses on speed and low resource usage; it's also compatible with many different types of hardware configurations. LXDE was designed to be lightweight enough so that it can run well even on older computers or netbooks--it features an extremely minimalistic interface but still provides all the basic functions needed by most users like browsing web pages and opening files/documents etc. Cinnamon has been around since 2012 but has since gained popularity due to its user-friendly nature while still maintaining some advanced features such as multi-monitor support, customizable themes/stylesheets etc.

## Command Line Interface

The shell is the command line interface that you use to interact with Linux. It's what you see when you open up a terminal window and type in commands, like ls or cd. There are many different shells available for Linux, but two of the most popular ones are Bash and Zsh.  
Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell (named after its creator), while Zsh stands for Z-Shell (named after itself). Both shells offer some advanced features such as aliases (shortcuts), tab completion, command history tracking, etc., but they differ slightly in their syntaxes and overall feel.  
Csh is another popular shell used on older versions of Unix systems like Solaris or HP-UX; however, it has fallen out of favor with modern developers due to its lack of features compared to other options available today such as Bash & Zsh

## Package Management

Package management is the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing software packages. Package managers typically handle dependencies automatically and can be used to install multiple packages at once.  
Linux has several different package managers:

* APT (Advanced Package Tool) is a command line tool that handles Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint. It's similar to Yum in functionality but has fewer features than RPM or Pacman.
    
* Yum is another command line tool that handles Red Hat-based systems like Fedora or CentOS. It's similar to Apt but has more features Apt does not handle dependency resolution by default so you'll need to use additional tools such as yum-utils or DNF (Dandified YUM).
    
* RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) is a third-party application that allows you to install software packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux machines without having root privileges on your computer!
    

## Linux Security

Linux security is a combination of user authentication, firewall, file permissions and encryption.

* User authentication: In Linux, you must be logged in as root or with another administrative account to make changes to system files or install software packages.
    
* Firewall: A firewall blocks unauthorized access from outside your computer network by controlling traffic between networks that are connected to each other through routers or gateways (a device that allows communication between two networks).
    
* File permissions: Every file has three types of permissions associated with it: read (r), write (w), and execute(x). If someone tries to access a file but does not have permission for any of these three types then they will not be able to access it at all!
    
* Encryption: Encryption is used when data needs protecting so that only authorized users can see it; this prevents hackers from accessing sensitive information stored on your computer
    
* **Day 2 Task: Basic Linux Commands**
    
* *Task 1. Check your present working directory.*
    
* Ans : " pwd "
    
* *Task 2. List all the files or directories including hidden files.*
    
* Ans : " ls -a "
    
* *Task 3. Create a nested directory A/B/C/D/E*
    
* Ans : " mkdir -p A/B/C/D "
